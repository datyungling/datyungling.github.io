Adventure of Hoc Tro (student in Vietnamese)

### Purpose
This is a place for me to highlight certain case studies, using what I learn and apply to real world problems.
This collection is focused on interactive tools rather than exploratory analysis, which will be published on my <a href="http://medium.com/yungcodes">Medium page</a>.
